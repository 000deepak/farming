## **1. Pre-Sowing / Basal Fertilization**

**Goal:** Provide nutrients for seed germination and early root development.

* **Fertilizers:**

  * Urea: 25–30 kg/acre
  * Single Super Phosphate (SSP): 50–60 kg/acre
  * Muriate of Potash (MOP/KCl): 20–25 kg/acre (if soil test shows K deficiency)

* **Reason:**

  * Phosphorus supports **root growth** and **early tillering**.
  * Nitrogen supports **initial vegetative growth**, but too much early N can cause **lodging**.
  * Potassium improves **disease resistance and drought tolerance**.

---

## **2. Tillering Stage (20–30 Days after Sowing)**

**Goal:** Promote **tiller formation** and overall vegetative growth.

* **Fertilizers:**

  * Urea: 20–25 kg/acre through fertigation
  * Zinc Sulfate (if deficient): 2–3 kg/acre

* **Reason:**

  * Nitrogen at this stage encourages **more tillers**, which translates to more potential spikes.
  * Zinc is essential for **enzyme activation and growth**.

## **3. Stem Elongation / Jointing Stage (40–50 Days after Sowing)**

**Goal:** Support **rapid vegetative growth and stem strengthening**.

* **Fertilizers:**

  * Urea: 20–25 kg/acre
  * MOP: 15–20 kg/acre (if soil K is low)
  * Boron (optional, if deficient): 1 kg/acre

* **Reason:**

  * Nitrogen ensures strong **stem elongation and spike development**.
  * Potassium strengthens **cell walls**, reducing lodging.
  * Boron is essential for **flower development and grain set**.

---

## **4. Booting / Heading Stage (60–70 Days after Sowing)**

**Goal:** Improve **spikelet formation and grain filling**.

* **Fertilizers:**

  * Urea: 15–20 kg/acre
  * MOP: 10–15 kg/acre

* **Reason:**

  * N and K at this stage improve **grain number and weight**, enhancing yield and quality.

---

## **5. Grain Filling / Milking Stage (90–100 Days after Sowing)**

**Goal:** Maximize **grain weight and protein content**.

* **Fertilizers:**

  * Urea: 10–15 kg/acre (optional, if crop looks N-deficient)
  * Potassium: 10 kg/acre (optional)

* **Reason:**

  * Final N boost improves **protein content**.
  * K helps in **starch translocation** and **grain filling**.

### **Fertigation Tips for Wheat**

1. Split N doses to **reduce losses** and improve efficiency.
2. Use water-soluble forms: **Urea, KNO₃, MAP, DAP**.
3. Monitor crop **for yellowing** (N deficiency), **stunted growth** (P deficiency), or **weak stems** (K deficiency).
4. Adjust rates based on **soil test**; these are average recommendations.
