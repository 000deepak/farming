### **1. Pre-Sowing / Seed Treatment**
* **Objective:** Ensure good germination and early root development.
* **Fertilizers:**
  * **Rhizobium inoculant:** Essential for N-fixation.
  * **Optional:** Small dose of phosphorus if soil P is low (e.g., 20–25 kg/acre of Single Super Phosphate [SSP]).
* **Reason:** Inoculation helps nodulation, which allows the plant to fix its own nitrogen. Phosphorus promotes root growth and early vigor.

### **2. Vegetative Stage (10-30)**
* **Stage:** From emergence to 5 trifoliate leaves.
* **Fertilizers (via fertigation):**
  * **Potassium (K2O):** 10–15 kg/acre using potassium sulfate (K2SO4).
  * **Micronutrients (if deficient):** Boron (B), Zinc (Zn) in chelated forms.
* **Reason:**
  * Potassium supports vegetative growth and stress resistance.
  * Micronutrients support enzymatic activity and chlorophyll production.

### **3. Flowering / Pod Initiation (45-60)**
* **Stage:** Beginning of flowering to pod formation.
* **Fertilizers (via fertigation):**
  * **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 10–15 kg/acre using mono ammonium phosphate (MAP) or DAP.
  * **Potassium (K2O):** 15 kg/acre using K2SO4.
  * **Boron (B):** 0.5–1 kg/acre foliar or fertigation.
* **Reason:**
  * Phosphorus is critical for flower and pod development.
  * Potassium supports water regulation and pod filling.
  * Boron is vital for flowering and pollination.

### **4. Pod Filling / Grain Development (60-80)**
* **Stage:** From pod filling to seed maturity.
* **Fertilizers (via fertigation):**
  * **Potassium (K2O):** 15–20 kg/acre using K2SO4.
  * **Sulfur (S):** 5–10 kg/acre (if deficient).
  * **Zinc (Zn) / Boron (B):** Foliar spray if needed.
* **Reason:**
  * Potassium improves seed size, weight, and protein content.
  * Sulfur is essential for amino acids and protein synthesis.
  * Micronutrients ensure quality seeds.

### **5. Maturity Stage (80-110)**
* **Stage:** Physiological maturity, harvest-ready seeds.
* **Fertilizers:** No major fertigation needed. Only maintain moisture until harvest.
* **Reason:** Plants are finishing nutrient uptake; extra fertilizers may be wasted.

### **6. Notes for 1 Acre**
* 1 acre ≈ 0.405 hectares.
* Calculate fertilizer doses proportionally based on soil test results. Soil test is crucial for accurate application.
* Use drip irrigation or sprinkler systems for effective fertigation.
* Maintain pH between 6–7 for nutrient availability.
* Avoid excess nitrogen as soybean is a legume and may reduce nodulation.
