## 1. **Pre-sowing & Germination (0–15 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: Starter Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Micronutrients
* Soybean seeds need a small dose of **N (4–6 kg/acre)** to support seedlings before nodules become active.
* **Phosphorus** is crucial for root growth, early nodulation, and energy transfer.
* **Zinc & Molybdenum** help in enzyme activity and nitrogen fixation.
* **Fertigation**:

  * Apply water-soluble **DAP (6–8 kg/acre)** or **MAP (5–9 kg/acre)**.
  * Add **Zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄)** and **Ammonium molybdate** (seed treatment or via fertigation).

## 2. **Vegetative Growth (15–35 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Sulfur (S), and Micronutrients.
* Nodules become functional; crop relies less on external N.
* **K and Ca** strengthen cell walls, aid photosynthesis, and improve stress tolerance.
* **Sulfur** is important for protein synthesis.
* **Fertigation**:

  * Supply **SOP (Sulphate of Potash, 0-0-50) 2–4 kg/acre split**.
  * Add **Calcium nitrate 2–3 kg/acre**.
  * Supplement **boron (B)** and **iron (Fe)** if deficiency-prone soils.

## 3. **Flowering & Pod Initiation (35–60 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: Potassium (K), Boron (B), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg).
* This is the **critical stage for yield**. Nutrient deficiency here reduces pod set.
* **K** improves flower retention, translocation of sugars, and pod filling.
* **Boron & Ca** help in pollen germination and pod setting.
* **Fertigation**:

  * **SOP 3–4 kg/acre weekly**.
  * **Calcium nitrate 2–3 kg/acre** alternate weeks.
  * **Magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄ 2 kg/acre)** if deficiency visible.
  * Foliar spray of **1% Borax** at pre-flowering if B deficiency suspected.

## 4. **Pod Filling & Maturity (60–90 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Micronutrients.
* **K** is most important now for seed filling, protein synthesis, and drought tolerance.
* **S** helps with protein content in grains.
* **Fertigation**:

  * **SOP 2–3 kg/acre weekly until pod maturity.**
  * Foliar spray of **1% KNO₃** during grain filling improves seed weight.
  * Avoid excess nitrogen at this stage (delays maturity, reduces seed quality).

✅ **General notes for soybean fertigation**:

* Total **N requirement is low (8–12 kg/acre)** since nodules fix most of it.
* **P requirement is high (16–25 kg/acre)** for root growth & nodulation.
* **K requirement (16–20 kg/acre)** is crucial for drought tolerance & pod filling.
* Micronutrients: Zn, Fe, B, Mo are especially important for legumes.
* Fertigation should always be in **split doses** rather than one-time application.
