### **Jowar Growth Stages & Nutrient Needs**

1. **Germination / Early Seedling Stage (0–20 days after sowing)**

   * **Nutrient focus:** Nitrogen (N) for early vegetative growth, Phosphorus (P) for root development.
   * **Fertilizers:**

     * Urea: small amount (~5–10 kg/acre)
     * DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate): ~15–20 kg/acre
   * **Micronutrients:** Zinc (Zn) if soil deficient.
   * **Method:** Apply via soil or starter fertigation if drip is set.

2. **Tillering Stage (20–40 DAS)**

   * **Nutrient focus:** Nitrogen is crucial for tiller formation; also some potassium (K) for stress tolerance.
   * **Fertilizers:**

     * Urea: 10–15 kg/acre
     * MOP (Muriate of Potash): 5–10 kg/acre
   * **Micronutrients:** Boron (B) can be sprayed if deficiency is suspected.
   * **Frequency:** Split N into 2–3 doses; can be applied via fertigation every 10–15 days.

3. **Panicle Initiation / Booting Stage (40–60 DAS)**

   * **Nutrient focus:** N and K are critical for grain formation; P helps with flowering.
   * **Fertilizers:**

     * Urea: 10–15 kg/acre
     * MOP: 10–15 kg/acre
     * DAP: 10 kg/acre
   * **Micronutrients:** Zinc and Iron (Fe) sprays improve grain setting.
   * **Fertigation:** Apply via drip or sprinkler; avoid heavy N late as it can delay maturity.

4. **Grain Filling / Flowering Stage (60–90 DAS)**

   * **Nutrient focus:** Potassium is most important for grain filling; some N may still be needed.
   * **Fertilizers:**

     * MOP: 10–15 kg/acre
     * Small dose of Urea if leaves are pale green.
   * **Micronutrients:** Foliar spray of Zn or B if required.
   * **Note:** Avoid excess N as it can increase lodging and disease susceptibility.

5. **Maturity Stage (90–120 DAS)**

   * No major fertigation needed; crop mainly uses stored nutrients.
   * Potassium at this stage can improve grain quality if deficiency is observed.

### **Key Points**

* **Split N application**: Reduces leaching and improves nitrogen use efficiency.
* **Phosphorus early**: Ensures strong root development.
* **Potassium late**: Enhances grain filling and stress tolerance.
* **Micronutrients**: Zinc, Boron, Iron as foliar sprays based on soil test.
* **Soil testing** before fertigation is highly recommended for precise doses.
