Got it 👍 — sweet corn (Zea mays saccharata) is a **heavy feeder** compared to chickpea, and since it's a short-duration, fast-growing crop, fertigation plays a huge role in maximizing cob size, sugar content, and yield.

Here’s a **stage-wise fertigation schedule for sweet corn** (assuming drip fertigation with soluble fertilizers):

---

## 1. **Germination & Establishment (0–15 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: Starter Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Zinc (Zn).
* Sweet corn seedlings need strong root growth + early vigor.
* **Fertigation**:

  * **Urea or UAN**: 10–15 kg/ha N (split across 2–3 irrigations).
  * **MAP (12-61-0)**: 8–10 kg/ha P.
  * **Zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄·7H₂O)**: 2–3 kg/ha via fertigation or foliar spray.

---

## 2. **Early Vegetative Growth (15–30 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: More N, balanced P, some K, and Mg.
* Plants build leaf area, chlorophyll, and stalk strength.
* **Fertigation**:

  * **Urea/Calcium nitrate**: 20–25 kg/ha N (split).
  * **MAP or 19:19:19**: 5–8 kg/ha.
  * **MgSO₄**: 5 kg/ha once for chlorophyll synthesis.

---

## 3. **Rapid Vegetative Growth (30–45 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: High N demand, moderate P & K, micronutrients.
* This is the **peak growth stage** where plants elongate quickly.
* **Fertigation**:

  * **Urea/Calcium nitrate**: 25–30 kg/ha N (weekly split).
  * **SOP (0-0-50)**: 5–8 kg/ha K.
  * **Micronutrient mix** (Zn, Fe, Mn, B): foliar or through fertigation.

---

## 4. **Tasseling & Silking (45–65 DAS)** – **critical stage**

* **Nutrient focus**: Very high N & K, Boron (B), Calcium (Ca).
* This stage determines **cob size, kernel number, and pollination success**.
* **Fertigation**:

  * **Urea/Calcium nitrate**: 20–25 kg/ha N weekly.
  * **SOP**: 10–12 kg/ha K weekly.
  * **Boron**: 1% foliar spray (or 1–2 kg/ha via drip).
  * **Ca (Calcium nitrate)**: 5–8 kg/ha, improves grain filling and prevents tip blanking.

---

## 5. **Grain Filling / Maturity (65–90 DAS)**

* **Nutrient focus**: More K than N, with Mg & S for sugar accumulation.
* **Fertigation**:

  * **SOP**: 8–10 kg/ha weekly until harvest.
  * **KNO₃ foliar spray (1%)** at milk stage → improves sweetness and kernel weight.
  * **N supply should taper down** to avoid excess vegetative growth.

---

✅ **General nutrient requirement for sweet corn (per hectare)**:

* **N**: 150–200 kg/ha (60% via fertigation).
* **P₂O₅**: 60–80 kg/ha.
* **K₂O**: 80–120 kg/ha.
* **Micronutrients**: Zn, B, Fe, Mg, and Ca are highly beneficial.
* Always apply nutrients in **weekly splits** through drip fertigation.

👉 Do you want me to create a **week-by-week fertigation calendar (with exact fertilizer grades like Urea, MAP, SOP, KNO₃, CaNO₃, etc.)** for sweet corn like I suggested for chickpea? That way, you can directly schedule fertigation without recalculating.
